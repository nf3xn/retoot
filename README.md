# retoots

The fediverse QT discussion. I am still at best ambivalent. 

A very basic chrome extension to add a button to the mastodon client to allow for easy retoots/retorts. Very VERY alpha. Like I just threw this together as a PoC.

If you want to use it download and extract this repo. The open the folder with 'load unpacked'. There are errors now and again since Brave does not like the dirty hacks to get the paste working (I do it twice) and sometimes the Mastodon client destroys the eventListeners so just refresh the page. And if you have to scroll for ages to the post maybe just better to click on the detailed view... no wait that is a bit flaky too. Anyway you YMMV for a little while but I am going to keep at it to iron out all these 'little bugs'. Feel free to use, copy or whatever it's on you. 

But lastly DON'T RUN RANDOM SHIT FROM THE INTERNET unless you REVIEW the code, watch out for nasty fetching of stuff from weird domains and execCommand is just paste an image here but it could have been nasty shit. In short do you reeeeealllyyyy trust store bought Chrome Extensions? I wish it were otherwise but it is not. Vscode extensions (see other repo) and chrome extensions bypass security, can bait and switch you. Take care and weigh the risk. Always be asking: Is the convenience really worth it?
