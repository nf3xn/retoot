# retoots

The fediverse QT discussion. I am still at best ambivalent. 

A very basic chrome extension to add a button to the mastodon client to allow for easy retoots/retorts. Very VERY alpha. Like I just threw this together as a PoC.

To use this extension, download and extract the repository, then open the folder using 'load unpacked' in the Extensions page [here](chrome://extensions). 

You may see some errors that occur while using the extension due to its use of 'dirty hacks' and interference from the Mastodon client. If you encounter any issues, refreshing the page may resolve them. However, if you have to scroll for a long time to access certain posts, the extension may not work properly on those, but you can click on them and the detailed status view will work better, I hope. I am working to fix these bugs and improve the extension. 

You are welcome to use, copy, or modify the extension as you see fit.

However, it's always important to be careful when running any unknown code from the internet. Make sure to review the code of any extensions before using them, and watch out for any that may be fetching data from suspicious domains or using the 'execCommand' function. Keep in mind that Chrome extensions, as well as Visual Studio Code extensions, can potentially bypass security measures and pose a risk to your system. Consider whether the convenience they provide is worth the potential risks before using them. Always be cautious and carefully weigh the potential risks. Stay frosty.
